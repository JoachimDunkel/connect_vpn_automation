# connect_vpn_automation

Connecting with open-vpn under Ubuntu is usually done via terminal.
This forces you to keep a terminal open for the connection.

There are existing GUI solutions that monitor an open-vpn connections, 
but these usually do not work if connecting to the network is done via a bash script that has to do additional stuff, like reading the company certificate. 

This solution is especially tailored to this use case.

After the application is properly setup, (See Section Setup) connecting to such a company vpn can then be done with one click and the connection stays open and can be monitored with an icon in the top bar.
No login necessary.

## Setup

Clone the repository.

Add a `configure_connection.yaml` in the directory root. (It should look as follows.)

```yaml

# Change this to your credentials (take a look at the source code if you are suspicious at that point. which is understandable)

SUDO_PW: ""
USER_NAME: ""
USER_PW: ""

# The connected public ipv4 address visible from the outside.
# This is there to check if a connection was established. Or if you are already connected to the vpn via another Ã¼rpces.

VPN_PUB_IP: ""

# Path to the script that will run openvpn internally

OPENVPN_SCRIPT_PATH: ""

```

## TODO 

### Setup gui

Connect with py gui.
handle connection status changes in the gui
Make it stay running in the ubuntu top bar.
Give it the power to stop the connection and so on.

### Security issue

At the moment a `configure_connection.yaml` file has to be added, that is excluded from version control.

This is annoying to setup and forces users to have such a plain text file with their credentials on their hardrive
(Should be encrypted or secured in some other way.)
