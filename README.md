Seems like adding an application to the top bar is non-trivial in ubuntu.
Only adding a gui is not any better then just keeping a terminal open. is it?

Permanently adding an icon to the top bar. is also not really good

Optimal would be to launch an application that stays open on the top bar.

Lets see which way this should go.
